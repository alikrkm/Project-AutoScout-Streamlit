
1. Open vs code and create a file named my_app.py
2. Create venv

   python -m venv senv (python3 but not python in ec2)

3. activate venv 

   source env_name/Scripts/activate  
   (if not works try without source)  
   (in linux/mac machines bin instead of Scripts) 

   (just "deactivate" to deactivate the venv)

4. add packages into venv

   pip install streamlit
   pip install streamlit

"""(pip list) to see the packages
   (pip freeze > requirement.txt) to create requirement file
   
   or 

   pip install -r requirement.txt        
   (if you already have requirement file)""""

  (python -V)
  (streamlit version)

5. streamlit run my_app.py
